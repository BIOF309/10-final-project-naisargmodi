Objective

The objective of this project is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants. Leaves, due to their volume, prevalence, and unique characteristics, are an effective means of differentiating plant species. My rationale behind selecting this particular project was to learn and understand the fundamental concepts of classification algorithms of machine learning. 


Methods

In this project, random forest algorithm is used to build a classifier for each species by utilizing the provided pre-extracted features. 
Python libraries used in the project are: Pandas, Tensorflow, numpy, Sci-kit Learn. 
Data was taken from a Kaggle Competition--Leaf Classification. The training set and test set can be found from train.csv.zip and test.csv.zip respectively. Both the test and training data are read as pandas dataframe which enables data manipulation and analysis. This gives us a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns - id, species, margin1, margin1, margin3.
